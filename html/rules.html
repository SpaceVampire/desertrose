<p><strong>Ignorance is not a excuse, read the rules.</strong></p>
<p>0. Use common sense. Being ignorant or just plain stupid is not an excuse.</p>
<p>    
	<br /><strong>General Rules</strong></p>
<p>2) Abusing the game mechanics to get out of roleplaying with someone runs contrary to the spirit of the game. This includes but is not limited to:</p>
<p>- Ganking</p>
<p>- Killing of SSDs</p>
<p>- Hoarding powerful items but not selling them</p>
<p>- Joining as a role and then deserting your faction</p>
<p>- Deliberately pulling or training enemies onto other players</p>
<p>- Breaking into someone's locked house to steal all their stuff while they're AFK</p>
<p>
    <br /><strong>Escalation Rules</strong></p>
<p>3) Escalation of violence is required in all situations, regardless of faction. You are here to Roleplay, not click each other until blood comes out. </p>
<p>- To begin escalation, you would verbally threaten the other player. Then, you can escalate it by drawing your weapon, signalling to the other player that you wish to begin combat.</p>
<p>- If someone draws a weapon after you draw yours, the combat phase automatically begins and both sides can commit violence.</p>
<p>- If you threaten someone but you are not holding a weapon, you must be pretty stupid, because if they draw theirs in response they're allowed to blast you.</p>
<p></p>
    <br /><strong>Examples of Escalation</strong></p>
<p>-- Example A: A raider walks up to an NCR cowboy with a weapon in hand and says, "Like the sight of your own blood?" The cowboy pulls a gun. Combat has been initiated.</p>
<p>-- Example B: A raider walks up to a wastelander with a weapon in hand and says, "Never shoulda come here." The wastelander turns and sprints away. Combat has not been initiated, and the raider can either pursue to capture, or give up, but must not shoot to kill.</p>
<p>-- Example C: A raider walks up to the Sherriff with nothing in their hands and says, "Give me all your money or else." The Sherriff can then draw their gun and shoot the raider to death for threatening them.</p>
<p>
<p> 3a) Wasteland Justice is acceptable. If someone is hostile to you, steals from you, treats you badly, or does something that makes you want to kill them, this is considered the beginning of escalation. Murder over IC issues is acceptable as long as there is roleplay leading up to it; it will not be considered "gank" in this case. Known criminals, such as Raiders, slavers, thieves and murderers, who are ICly recognized as such without meta, have escalated themselves and are valid.</p>
<p>- Raiders and Legion who have not escalated or established themselves as a known IC threat are *not* valid and must be roleplayed with. Even if you recognize someone as belonging to these factions based on their gear, you must have an IC reason to start blasting. </p>
<p>- "My character hates the Legion!" is not a good reason. If your character hates the Legion, threaten them with violence and pull your gun, giving them a chance to pull theirs and begin combat.</p>
<p>3b) If a shootout between two factions begins, or open war is declared, both sides are allowed to protect their faction members from the other side by any means neccessary. This is the only case in which escalation is bypassed. </p>

<p>3c) It is acceptable to surrender and ask in LOOC to be left alive. This should be respected unless there is an IC based reason to kill that player. However any other actions are acceptable when you have someone captive.</p>
<p>- If you have someone captive, you are required to roleplay with them. Locking someone alone in a room is not roleplay.</p>
<p> 3d) Any one of any faction is allowed to make a threat of violence and thereby begin the escalation process, as long as it makes sense IC to do so.</p>
<p>- If someone runs away or surrenders, you are required to roleplay with them and not just shoot them in the back. A fleeing target who has not escalated can be pursued and shot at to slow them down, but must be captured alive and not killed. A fleeing target who has escalated, such as shooting at you or stealing from you, can be killed.</p>

<p>4) Raiders or other antagonistic characters should be on the server in order to drive roleplay forward. Antags are expected to provide a story-based threat, not merely a mechanics-based one.</p>

<p>5) If you are playing a Canon Faction, you are required to know the lore of that faction. This includes NCR, Legion, BOS.</p>
<p>- Non-canon Factions, such as Wastelanders and Townies, are allowed to be played without knowledge of Fallout's canon, however it is strongly encouraged to know at least the basics. You are allowed to play someone who does not know where they are or what is going on, but strongly encouraged to find a way to roleplay that (brain damage, amnesia, ignorant tribal, etc).</p>

<p>6) While this is an English speaking server, you are allowed to speak other languages in character. However, if you are unable to communicate OOCly with admins, success is not guaranteed.</p>

<p>7) You are strongly encouraged to ahelp with any questions, concerns, requests, or problems. If there is no admin online, contact @Ziii#5598 on Discord.</p>
<p>- Most reasonable requests will be honored, but don't push your luck.</p>
